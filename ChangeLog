	* Include/globals.h: fix includes.

	* Include/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): add globals.h,

Wed Jan 19 23:31:36 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* *.c: include <volume_io/foo.h> for internal volume_io headers.

Wed Jan 19 21:52:21 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* TODO: new.

	* configure.in: check for SGI's iris image library.

	* Images/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS, _LIBADD): include flags for
	finding the iris image library and headers.

	* Images/rgb_io.c: do not test OS-dependent symbols (__sgi) for
	the image library; now the code is controlled by HAVE_IMAGE_H
	symbol.

	* Include/Makefile.am (all-local): test -l doesn't exist on linux.

Wed Jan 19 18:05:49 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/Makefile.am (all-local): test -e doesn't exist on IRIX5.

	* Volumes/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): 
	* Numerical/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): include `header' files
	that are named ending in '.c', and hence can't be put into a
	_SOURCES variable, lest they get compiled.

	* */Makefile.am: put -I$(top_srcdir)/Include into AM_CPPFLAGS
	rather than AM_CFLAGS, since it gets put on the command line
	before CPPFLAGS, and the latter might have -I flags that point to
	*installed* versions of the headers.

	* Include/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): new.  List all the
	headers that get installed under include/bicpl.

	* Include/Makefile.am (all-local): make symlink bicpl -> ., so
	that including <bicpl/foo.h> picks up foo.h in the source tree,
	not the previously-installed copy.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): put Include first in the list, since the
	Include/bicpl link needs to be done first.

	* AUTHORS: put in Dave's name and mine.

Wed Jan 19 16:32:48 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Include/Makefile.am (pkginclude_HEADERS): install all headers
	included by including <bicpl.h>.

	* Include/*.h: modify installed headers to include <bicpl/foo.h>
	rather than just <foo.h>; this avoids problems with common header
	names, such as stack.h and the like.  Also, some are incestuously
	including internal volume_io headers, which get modified to
	include <volume_io/foo.h>.

	* acinclude.m4 (AC_PRETTY_HELP_STRING): remove the occurances of
	"if ! command" and "while ! command", which isn't supported by
	IRIX 5.3 /bin/sh.

Wed Jan 19 02:40:27 2000  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: volume_io needs -lm on IRIX.

	* configure.in: search -lnetcdf for `ncopen' rather than
	`nc_open', as the latter does not appear in NetCDF 2.3.

	* configure.in: remove AC_PROG_RANLIB; rendered obsolete by
	AM_PROG_LIBTOOL.

	* NEWS
	* README
	* acinclude.m4
	* configure.in: new.  Set up for automake, autoconf, and libtool.

	* version.c: new.  It seems that libtool requires at least one
	real object file in a library to be happy.
