This library contains support code originally written by David MacDonald,
and previously released as part of his "display" and "Register" programs.

The following libraries MUST be installed before you can build
bicpl:

  NetCDF - see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/
  MINC   - see ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/minc/


In addition, it is recommended that at least one of the following
libraries be installed.  The bicpl package will compile without
any of them, but you won't be able to load or save bitmapped images.

  NetPBM             - see http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/
  IRIS image library - available from SGI for IRIX systems

See INSTALL and INSTALL.bicpl for installation instructions.
